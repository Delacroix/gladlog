/**
 * Cache key for the cohort-comparison cache (desktop's `compare.json`) — the
 * version of *this file's* prompt. Unrelated to the findings prompt version in
 * `shared/promptVersion.ts`.
 *
 * Single-source predicate: bump it here when buildExemplarLedPrompt's output
 * changes, or when verifiedComparison's set of dimensions changes. The writer
 * (compare.ts `finish`) and the reader (`getCached`) share this one constant.
 *
 * Why it has to be its own constant (2026-08-02): compare.json used to key off
 * the analysis PROMPT_VERSION, which has no causal relation to it — so every
 * findings-prompt bump (13→14→15 within two days, 2026-08-01/02) silently voided
 * every stored cohort comparison in the library, and the "vs your cohort" panel
 * simply vanished with no explanation. v1 is the decoupling point; older
 * compare.json files store the analysis version (3/14/15…), which will not equal
 * 1 and is therefore treated as stale. That is intended — the old predicate had
 * already invalidated them — so there is no migration.
 *
 * v2 (2026-08-12): exemplars scrubbed of gate contraband + verdict values
 * exposed + no-invented-numbers rule (probe: 27/36 narrations were being
 * killed by claimChecker under v1).
 *
 * v3 (2026-08-25, #37 缺口一/三): the "how this cohort actually plays" section
 * rendered from cell.rotationSummary — deliberately DIGIT-FREE (shares become
 * the words standard/common/occasional) so the model can never echo a raw
 * number claimChecker would kill.
