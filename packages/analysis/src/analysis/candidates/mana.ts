/**
 * REVIEW PRESCRIPTION (Task 1 review round 0, binding — task-3-brief.md item
 * 2 / progress.md), fixed round 1 (Task 3 review, Important finding —
 * locale-string ruling): `oomWindows`' `toS` truncates at the last
 * BELOW-threshold mana SAMPLE, but samples come only from successful casts
 * (`SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS`'s advanced block) — during severe/terminal OOM those
 * go sparse while `SPELL_CAST_FAILED` keeps firing, so the sample-based
 * `toS` systematically undershoots the true end of the OOM period. Verified
 * on 60ab1e8f: `oomWindows` gives `toS=504.806` but death (the true end of
 * the crisis) is at `508.687` — a ~3.9s tail the sample-based window misses
 * entirely.
 *
 * This walks the window's own trailing `CastFailedEvent` timestamps forward
 * from `sampleToS`, extending `toS` to the last one reachable through a
 * chain of gaps each <= `MANA_PRESSURE_TAIL_MAX_GAP_S` — the same "keep the
 * window open while there is still *something* happening, close it on real
 * silence" shape `oomWindows` itself already uses for its own mana-sample
 * stream (see that function's doc comment), just applied to the failure
 * stream instead. Never shrinks `toS` — a unit with no qualifying trailing
 * failures returns `sampleToS` unchanged, byte-identical to not having this
 * extension at all.
 *
 * **Locale-independent gate (round 1 fix).** The original implementation
 * only bridged `CastFailedEvent`s whose `reason` field string-matched the
 * literal Chinese text `"法力值不足"` — `reason` is WoW's client-localized
 * combat-log text (rawStreams.ts's own module comment), so that check
 * silently never matched on any non-Chinese-client log (an English client
 * emits a different string entirely), making the whole tail-extension a
 * silent no-op for those logs with no signal that it had degraded. Fixed by
 * dropping reason-text matching entirely: a trailing `CastFailedEvent`
 * bridges the window (regardless of its `reason`) iff `manaAt(s, unitGuid,
 * c.tSeconds)` — the SAME single-source mana-lookup predicate `oomWindows`
 * itself is built on — shows the healer's mana still below `lowPct`% at
 * that failure's own instant. `manaAt` is nearest-sample-<=t, so across the
 * sparse-sample stretch this function exists to bridge it naturally holds
 * the last known (low) reading — exactly the "was the crisis still ongoing
 * when this cast was rejected" semantics wanted here, with no separate
 * hold-last-value logic needed. No sample yet at/before a failure (`manaAt`
 * returns `null`) cannot confirm the crisis was still active, so it does NOT
 * bridge (conservative: never extends on missing data). A failure whose
 * mana had already recovered above `lowPct`% (e.g. a Line-of-Sight
 * rejection moments after mana topped back up) also does not bridge — and
 * per this same reasoning, if the crisis had truly recovered, `oomWindows`
 * itself would already have closed the window at that recovery's own
 * SAMPLE (see that function's contiguous-run rule), so a genuinely-recovered
 * instant reachable from this walk can only arise from a stale hold-over —
 * i.e. this check is a correctness backstop for an edge shape, not a
 * load-bearing gate on the common path.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT reach for `_HEAL`/`_DAMAGE` advanced-block sample
 * densification (flagged as an option in the Task 1 review, explicitly ruled
 * out of scope for this task by the review's own OOM-sparsity ruling) —
 * `castFailedInWindow`'s existing timestamps are already sufficient signal
 * for this window-boundary purpose without adding a second sample source.

 * (`facts.mana`, e.g. "545/273000"), the rejected-cast count aggregated by
 * reason (`facts.rejectedCount`/`facts.rejected` — reuses

 * there was active enemy threat/contact anywhere in the window
 * (`facts.threat`, sampled every rendered second via the injected
 * `threatActiveAt` probe — `threatAssessment.ts`'s single-source predicate,
