/**
 * Parsing of the model's JSON output (**single source**).
 *
 * Fact: even when the prompt says "Output ONLY a JSON array" verbatim, models
 * still routinely wrap the content in a markdown fence, or add a sentence or
 * two of prose around it — especially when the system prompt also demands a
 * reply in Chinese. Reproduced by measurement on a real match with `claude -p`
 * on 2026-07-20: the reply was **fully compliant** content wrapped in
 * ```json … ```, yet main's JSON.parse(raw.trim()) judged it bad-json and a
 * perfectly good analysis fell back to the deterministic display.
 *
 * eval's three audit scripts had each written their own fence tolerance long
 * ago, but the product side had none — two places holding inconsistent beliefs
 * about the same fact, exactly the kind of rot CLAUDE.md warns about. So the
 * predicate lives here and both sides import it.
 *
 * **Tolerance boundaries** (the negative contract of parseModelJsonArray
 * below; do not loosen them):
 *   - truncated JSON is unrecoverable → null (emitting half is worse than
 *     falling back)
 *   - a top-level object → null (the contract is an array; this is a genuine
 *     contract violation, not formatting noise)
