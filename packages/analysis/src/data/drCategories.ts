/**
 * DR (diminishing returns) category table.
 * Made official 2026-07-25: the five main categories (stun / incapacitate /
 * disorient / silence / root) are now generated from DB2
 * SpellCategories.DiminishType (drCategoriesGenerated, genDrCategories), keyed
 * by **aura id** to match the combat log's SPELL_AURA_APPLIED. During the
 * migration the official data caught 2 misclassifications in the hand-written
 * table (Mind Control 605 incap→disorient, Scatter Shot 213691
 * disorient→incap) plus 5 dead entries keyed by cast ids that never matched a
 * log line (which is why Shockwave 46968's stun DR had never worked — its real
 * aura 132168, x512 across 30 matches, is in the official set).
 * disarm/knockback have no official DiminishType field (a gap), so they stay
 * hand-written.
 * DB2's known quirks (Cyclone's independent DR, Incapacitating Roar actually
 * being disorient) are corrected afterwards by drAnalysis' override layer —
 * do not patch them here.
