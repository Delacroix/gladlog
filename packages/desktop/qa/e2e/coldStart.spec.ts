 * A separate file rather than piggybacking on flow 1 -- flow 1 is a
 * functional test whose failure should mean "the flow is broken", whereas a
 * budget failure means "it got slower". Mixed together, a single red light
 * has two meanings and the reader has to click in to find out which.
 *
 * Takes the median of 3 runs: a single sample on a shared runner is far too
 * easily disturbed by neighbours into a false red.
