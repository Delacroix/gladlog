/**
 * One-shot sidecar builder (perf-1): byte-scan match.json for the per-round
 * offsets and write rounds.idx.json next to it, so subsequent opens read +
 * parse only the shell and the active round. Runs off the main thread (the
 * scan is a full pass over up-to-277MB files, ~seconds).
 *
 * Validation before writing (fail-open: no sidecar is just the slow path):
 * the assembled shell and every round range must each JSON.parse on their own,
 * and the stat taken BEFORE reading must still match after — a concurrent
 * rewrite (slim self-heal) between read and write would otherwise persist
 * offsets into bytes that no longer exist.
