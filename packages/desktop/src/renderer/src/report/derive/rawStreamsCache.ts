/**
 * Intent guard (BACKLOG #26 Task 2, 意图守护): a session-lifetime, in-memory
 * cache of `RawStreams` keyed by `source.id` (a match's or shuffle round's
 * own content-hash id — the same value every caller already passes around as
 * `matchId`; ShuffleReport sets `matchId={round.id}` `source={round}`
 * verbatim, so the two are always identical in practice). Backs
 * `extractCandidateFindings`'s optional `rawStreams` param in
 * `analysisInput.ts`.
 *
 * Two ids, one cache key: `source.id` (round-specific — each shuffle round
 * needs its OWN parsed `RawStreams`, since `parseRawStreams` bakes in
 * `baseMs` = that round's own startTime) is NOT the same as the on-disk
 * STORAGE id `MatchStore` resolves raw.txt from (for a shuffle, that is the
 * *lobby's* directory, "= first round's id" per `MatchReport.tsx`'s
 * `videoMatchId` doc comment — rounds 2-6 have a different `source.id` from
 * it). So every write here takes an explicit `storageId` (defaults to the
 * cache key for the common case where they coincide — a regular match, or a
 * shuffle's first round) while the cache itself stays keyed by the
 * round-specific id every reader already has.
 *
 * Why a cache instead of an inline `await` inside `buildAnalysisInput`/
 * `buildWindowAnalysisRequest`: both are called SYNCHRONOUSLY, several times,
 * from many render-path call sites (StructuredAnalysisPanel, VideoTab,
 * CoachChatCard, MatchReport's own window-analysis loop) — making them async
 * to await an IPC round-trip on every call would ripple into every one of
 * those callers' effect/memo plumbing, a much bigger blast radius than this
 * task's guard warrants. Instead: `prefetchRawStreams`/`ensureRawStreams` are
 * the ONLY writers (called from `MatchReport.tsx` on mount, with the correct
 * `storageId`, and from `batchAnalysis.ts`'s driver, which has the real
 * on-disk id directly from the match list) — `buildAnalysisInput`/
 * `buildWindowAnalysisRequest` only ever do a synchronous `getRawStreamsSync`
 * READ, never trigger a write themselves. This is deliberate, not an
 * oversight: a reader that doesn't know the correct `storageId` and
 * defaulted to guessing (cache key == storage id) could, on a shuffle round
 * 2-6, race the correct writer and poison the cache with a false
 * `available:false` (the wrong directory simply doesn't exist) that the
 * later correct write would never overwrite (`fetchRawStreams` short-circuits
 * once an entry exists). Keeping writes to the few call sites that actually
 * know the right storage id avoids that failure mode entirely.
 *
 * `parseRawStreams` on the largest sampled real raw.txt (Task 1 report:
 * 70.8MB) took 681ms end-to-end including the read, so a match-open-time
 * kickoff comfortably beats a user's click. A cache miss (prefetch hasn't
 * landed yet, or no `window.gladlog` bridge — fixture/E2E mode) degrades to
 * `undefined`, and every downstream consumer already treats `rawStreams`
 * absent as "keep existing behavior" (Global Constraint, docs/superpowers/
 * plans/2026-08-15-raw-streams.md) — so a cold cache is never a correctness
 * bug, only a missed guard for that one call.
