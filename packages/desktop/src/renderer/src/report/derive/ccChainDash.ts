 * applied to each enemy target, with DR-degraded / immune applications flagged
 * red. Every decision consumes analysis' analyzeOutgoingCCChains (the same
 * predicate as the timeline's [DR] annotation) — drAnalysis.ts:311-318
 * explicitly forbids filtering by DR tier, so nothing is filtered here either;
 * the aggregation happens purely in the presentation layer.
 *
 * range (time-window linkage ①): the DR sequence is computed over the full
 * stream (so chain length / degradation decisions are unaffected by window
 * boundaries — otherwise the first application inside the window would be
 * misjudged as Full), and only then are the apps filtered for display. A CC
 * application is a "duration fact" (it has atSeconds + durationSeconds), so it
 * is judged by overlapping seconds using timeRange.ts's predicate (the same
 * predicate as statsTable.ts's CC instance filtering/timing), NOT by the
 * instantaneous tInRange: otherwise an application starting outside the window
 * but mostly inside it would be dropped whole (caught by the agy flash review
 * and adopted).
